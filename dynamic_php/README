This is a web program that is supposed to support 
1. User Registration
2. User Login
3. Image Uploading
4. Image Viewing

I am writing this for my Software Engineering 2 course at Radford University

This program is currently vulnerable to most types of attack, including
-SQL injection
-DDOS
-XSS

Currently I have completed
1. User Registration
2. User Login
3. Image Uploading
4. Image Viewing
5. Image Viewing based on Album

I hope to complete
1. Image Removal
2. Sanitation of inputs
3. Cookie-based authorization 
4. User Deletion
