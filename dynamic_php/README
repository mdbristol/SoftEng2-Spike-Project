This is a web program that is supposed to support 
1. User Registration
2. User Login
3. Image Uploading
4. Image Viewing

I am writing this for my Software Engineering 2 course at Radford University

This program is currently vulnerable to most types of attack, including
-SQL injection
-DDOS
-XSS

Currently I have completed

2. User Login
3. Image Uploading

I hope to complete
1. Image Viewing
2. Image Removal
3. Sanitation of inputs
4. Cookie-based authorization 
5. Image Viewing based on Album
6. User Deletion
